/**
 * The Golden Thread as one continuous film. Clips play in this order inside a single pinned stage.
 * Each clip ends on the frame the next one starts on (see film/shots.json), so the joins don't show.
 *
 * - `weight`: screen-heights of scrolling this clip takes.
 * - `playShare`: share of that scroll over which the clip plays; the rest holds on its last frame
 *   (used where type needs reading time).
 * - `frames`: the clip's frame sequence, which FilmStage scrubs on a canvas.
 * - `light`: the frame is bright, so cards switch to ink and the scrim goes.
 * - Card `in`/`out` are 0–1 through the clip.
